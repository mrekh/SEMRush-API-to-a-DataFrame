# SEMRush API response to a Pandas DataFrame
Since the SEMRush API reponse is a string, who can manipulate the string to extract the data?

I wrote a function you can find in 'main.py' that converts the response string into a Pandas DataFrame that can be used for sorting, writing to an Excel or CSV file, etc.

Enjoy it ðŸ˜‰.
